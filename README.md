# Mjolnir_DR:
Hello! This is Mjolnir, a simple portable application designed to simplify copying files via the command line on Windows, Mac and Linux.

# Features and Limitations:
You can use Mjolnir to quickly copy-paste files. it's basically a portable copy tool for multiple platforms for the CLI.
It is a software that you can put on a thumb drive and use to copy a directory to said thumb drive through the command line. Nothing much, just one of my first scripting projects. I wrote these scripts when I was 17, I didn't really realize then that they were so redundant, however I am keeping these up for posterity, and maybe I'll build on them one day.
Thanks all,
