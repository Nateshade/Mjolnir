# Mjolnir_DR:
Hello! This is Mjolnir_DR, a simple portable application to be used for data collection and reading on Windows and Linux.

# Features and Limitations:
(Please keep current!)
You can use Mjolnir_DR quickly copy-paste files to a thumb drive or SD card. This can only be used, however, on computers that already are unlocked, and encrypted files cannot be decrypted using this software. This can be fixed, but I am not a coding wizard, so if you want to be able to do those things with this software, please help me with this code. If you do, please add comments to tell what it is doing, and modify the readme with the new features.

PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE INAPPROPRIATELY! This software is ONLY for convenience, testing, and other such white hat purposes.

# Everything else you need to know:
As I said, I am no code wizard. if you think I am bad at coding, just fix my errors, or make a branch or fork that is better. Please, don't be a grouch.
I am 17, and I learned most of my coding skills myself, or with online tools.


# Thanks all.
